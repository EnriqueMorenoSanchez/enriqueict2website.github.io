            <h3><strong>Tables</strong></h3>
                <p>For adding tables you have to write the following:</p>
                <p class="Theory"><"table"><br>
                    <"thead><br>
                        <"tr"><br>
                            <"th"><"/th"><br>
                        <"/tr"><br>
                    <"/thead><br>
                    <"tbody"><br>
                        <"tr"><br>
                            <"td"><"/td"><br>
                        <"/tr"><br>
                    <"/tbody"><br>
                <"/table"><br>
                </p>
                <p>An example of this would be:</p>

                <table class="Examples">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Menu</th>
                            <th>Price</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Spaghetti</td>
                            <td>30$</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Fish and chips</td>
                            <td>25$</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

            <h3><strong>How to include Comments</strong></h3>
                <p>For adding Comments you have to do the following things. Firstly, you write <strong class="bold">"<"</strong>, followed by <strong class="bold">"!--"</strong> and then<br>
                you include the message you want to tell. After that, you finish with <strong class="bold">"-->"</strong>.</p>
                <p>The message you write can only be see in the html code of the wegpage.</p>
                
            <h3><strong>How to include links to other webpages/websites and to other parts of the same website</strong></h3>
                <p>For adding links to other pages, you have to type the following:<br>

                </p>

        <h2>Intro to CSS</h2>

            <h3>Id and Class</h3>

                <p>For adding an Id to a paragraph, for example, you need to add inside<br>
                the <strong class="bold">"<"p">", "Id", then "=" and give a name after that between "_"</strong>. Afer that<br>
                you just need to create inside <strong class="bold">"<"head">" "<"style">"</strong> and then add the following thing:<br>
                
                <p class="Theory">#name{<br>

                }
                </p>
                <p>Same happens with Class, instead of using Id, you select it as <strong class="bold">"class"</strong> and then instead of using "#", you use "."</p>
                <p>You can find examples of both methods in the <a href="#Example Id-Class">example of unorderlist</a>, where all the white-blue lines are inside a class,<br>
                while the red-blue one has an id. </p>

            <h3>Select by tag name</h3>

                    <p>It is similar to what you have done in the previous step. However, you won't use any Id or Class.<br>
                    You are just going to type the exact thing you want to select. For example, a paragraph: You create <br>
                    inside <strong class="bold">"<"style">"</strong>:<br></p>
                    <p class="Theory">p{<br>

                    } </p>
                    <p>You can see these in the titles of this webpage.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you add properties to what you have selected, like adding colors,etc.<br>
                        For adding colors you write inside "color:" and then "rgb()" or just the name of <br>
                        the color
                    </p>
